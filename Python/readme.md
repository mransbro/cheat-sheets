## Data Structures

```python
# List are enclosed in square brackets are immuptable and contain different data types
random_data = [1,2,'friday',4.6,True]
```

```python
# Tuples are created with round brackets are immuptable and much faster to use
months = ('JAN','FEB','MAR','APR','MAY','JUN', 'JUL','AUG','SEP','OCT','NOV','DEC')
```

```python
# Dictonary or dict use curly brackets. 
members = {33333:'John Smith', 22222:'Monica Small'}
```

```python
# Sets are unordered collections of unique data
a = {1,2,3,4,5}
b = {4,5,6,7}

a | b # Union

a & b # 

a ^ b # Unique
  
a - b # difference
```
