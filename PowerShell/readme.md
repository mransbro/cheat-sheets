```

```powershell
<#
Multi line comments are
also simple to

```powershell
@"
Multi line strings are possible.
Just make sure,
the opening @" token must be at the end of the line
and the ending token at the beginning of the line
"@
```

```powershell
# All variables in PowerShell start with $ and they dont care how you capitalise them
$ImAVarIablE = 'Store data in me'
$AMIVALID = 'totally'

# Although it doesnt affect the variable, PowerShell guidelines generally uses PascalCase
$LikeThis = 'Much easier to read'
